<h1>Protect against ransomware</h1>

An organization can take immediate steps to protect against ransomware variants.

<ol>
<li>Back up data regularly.</li> Verify the integrity of those backups and test the restoration process to ensure it’s working.
<li>Secure offline backups.</li> Backups are essential: if you’re infected, a backup may be the only way to recover your data. Ensure backups are not connected permanently to the computers and networks they are backing up.
<li>Configure firewalls to block access to known malicious IP addresses.</li>
<li>Logically separate networks.</li> This will help prevent the spread of malware. If every user and server is on the same network newer variants can spread.
<li>Patch operating systems, software, and firmware on devices.</li> Consider using a centralized patch-management system.
Implement an awareness and training program. End users are targets, so everyone in your organization needs to be aware of the threat of ransomware and how it’s delivered.
Scan all incoming and outgoing emails to detect threats and filter executable files from reaching end users.
Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users and authenticate inbound email using technologies such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to prevent spoofing.
Block ads. Ransomware is often distributed through malicious ads served when visiting certain sites. Blocking ads or preventing users from accessing certain sites can reduce that risk.
Use the principle of ‘least privilege’ to manage accounts: No users should be assigned administrative access unless absolutely needed. If a user only needs to read specific files, the user should not have write access to them.
Leverage next-generation antivirus (NGAV) technology to inspect files and identify malicious behaviour to block malware and non-malware attacks that exploit memory and scripting languages like PowerShell.
Use application whitelisting, which only allows systems to execute programs known and permitted by security policy.
Categorise data based on organizational value and implement physical and logical separation of networks and data for different organisational units.
<li>Conduct an annual penetration test and vulnerability assessment.</li>
</ol>
