<p class="intro">
<h4>What it is and why it matters</h4>
<span class="dropcap">B</span>ig data is a blanket term for the non-traditional strategies and technologies needed to gather, organize, process, and gather insights from large datasets. While the problem of working with data that exceeds the computing power or storage of a single computer is not new, the pervasiveness, scale, and value of this type of computing has greatly expanded in recent years.</p>

<h3>Major Benefits of Big Data</h3>
<ol>
<li>Answer More Questions, More Completely</li>
Managing a business or business processes is as much about answering questions as anything else.
<ul>
<li>What do customers want?</li>
<li>What are our customers’ needs?</li>
<li>Who are our best customers?</li>
<li>Why do people choose a different brand or solution?</li>
<li>Even on a daily basis, the number of questions business leaders can ask is staggering.
</li>
</ul>
Before today’s more streamlined big data analytics offerings, answering even seemingly simple questions such as “Who are my 10 best customers?” could take up to 60 days for business teams to analyze. Even after they figured out the right criteria, actually compiling and analyzing the data was a time-consuming process. The burden only grew as questions became more complex.
</ol>
<h3>What Does a Big Data Life Cycle Look Like?</h3>
So how is data actually processed when dealing with a big data system? While approaches to implementation differ, there are some commonalities in the strategies and software that we can talk about generally. While the steps presented below might not be true in all cases, they are widely used.

The general categories of activities involved with big data processing are:
<ul>
<li>Ingesting data into the system</li>
<li>Persisting the data in storage</li>
<li>Computing and Analyzing data</li>
<li>Visualizing the results</li>
</ul>
