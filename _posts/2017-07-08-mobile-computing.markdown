<h3>Mobile Computing current trends in Uganda and the opportunities herein</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mobile applications for good governance</li>
There is a very wide range of potential governance related services which can be delivered and
communicated via mobile phones, including services relating to health care, agriculture, education,
employment, transportation law and order, tax, judicial and legal systems, etc. Mobile payments,
now available in all East African countries, opens up for even greater opportunities and possibilities
for transactions (bill/loan/fine payments and mobile payments for a variety of public services like
transport and school fees). However, integrating systems and back-end is complex. For example,
how to go ahead in a country like Uganda where there is no functioning ID-system in place?
<ul>
<li>Healthcare in Uganda </li>
Uganda, just like many other developing countries has a shortage of medical
personnel, especially specialists such as pathologists, dermatologists, radiologists and
cardiologists among others.<br>
Telemedicine has become a method of choice for
improved access to quality healthcare services world over. The
technology, which has been used for decades in the developed
world, is now being diffused to developing countries.
